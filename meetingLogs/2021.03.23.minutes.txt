Meeting 2021/03/23

Minoj and Ryan were unable to attend, but emailed Vish to let him know.

Greg: Login functionality is working. Started looking into location services

Jules: User Profile/edit profile get and post requests connecting front end to back end

Josh: Plugged back end into front end. Tasks and reeviews are now being loaded from DB, reviews can be created from UI.

[I had Minoj and Ryan send updates so their updates could be included in the logs]
Minoj: working/testing my connection from our registration page (frontend)  to the backend nodeJS. I have made so good headway and believe I should be down with this by end of the week.

Ryan: landing page and working on filter button for user favorite tasks

Vish said progress looks pretty good, advised that we be careful of git conflicts. 
Everyone feels pretty good about where we are, no major blockers currently.
